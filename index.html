            <p>A global community is a rule-bound society of individual people who come together to share a particular set of concerns.People often identify with their culture and nation, but now they can also identify as participants in the "global community." This new identity is important because it opens up more avenues for constructive dialogue and facilitates possibilities for cooperation amongst those who would otherwise be competing rivals.</p>

        <p>The drama “If Not Now, When?” owes more to “Waiting to Exhale” than to the women-centric films of Tyler Perry. That’s a good thing, as well as intentional on the part of its first-time feature directors, actors Meagan Good and Tamara Bass.</p>
